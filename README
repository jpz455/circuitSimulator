ation mode.
Features
Calculate distributed parameters ( R', L', C', G' )
Compute lossy and lossless characteristic impedance
Compute propagation constants (alpha, beta) and wavelength
Analyze power loss along the cable
Visualize coaxial cable geometry
Plot:
Attenuation vs frequency
Characteristic impedance vs frequency
Wavelength vs frequency
Voltage propagation along the cable
Plot normalized reflection coefficients on a Smith Chart
Suggest shunt capacitor values for impedance matching
Validate tool calculations against real-world catalog specifications
Example Workflow
After running Test.m, select:

Welcome to our Coaxial Cable Design Tool! Would you like to: 1. Design your own cable 2. Verify the software Please enter 1 or 2: 1

Sample user inputs:

Inner conductor radius = 1 mm
Dielectric outer radius = 5 mm
Outer conductor radius = 10 mm
Cable length = 5 m
Materials: Bare Copper (inner and outer), Polyethylene (dielectric)
Operating frequency = 1 GHz
Operating voltage = 1.28 V
Outputs:

Distributed parameters (R', L', C', G')
Characteristic impedance (lossy and lossless)
Wavelength and propagation constants
Power attenuation and voltage plots
Smith Chart impedance visualization
Shunt capacitor value for matching a given load impedance
Limitations
Assumes materials are non-magnetic (relative permeability mu_r = 1)
Assumes negligible dielectric conductivity unless specified
